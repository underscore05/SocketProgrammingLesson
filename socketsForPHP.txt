Conventional way of Server Application (PHP)

//Create a container for a collection of socket
sockets = array()

//Create a socket
//Bind it in a specific port and add the newly created server socket in the collection variabl
sockets[] = serverSocket = socket_create_listen(9001);


//create a copy of sockets collection
_sockets = sockets

//Monitor collection of sockets for changes (this includes the server socket)
//Socket_select accepts an array of sockets which is passed by reference that's why 
//we created a copy of sockets collection to avoid modifying it 

$socket_count = @socket_select(_sockets, $write = null, $except = null, 0);

//check for socket_count then go in the next poll if socket_count < 1
//serverSocket is in _sockets then accept connection


$socket_count = @socket_select($_sockets, $write = null, $except = null, 0);
if(in_array($serverSocket, $_sockets)) {
	$sockets[] = $clientSocket = socket_accept($serverSocket);
	$key = array_search($serverSocket, $_sockets);
	unset($_sockets[$key]);
}

foreach($_sockets as $socket) {
	//read socket
	$data = socket_read($socket, $size, PHP_NORMAL_READ);
	if($data==false) 
		//disconnected, then delete it from sockets array
	else
		if(trim(data)!="")
			//print new data
			
	
}
